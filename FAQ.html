        <h2><b>Can I stream or create Hollow Knight videos? And is it okay if I monetise them?</b></h2>
        <p class="questions_text">You sure can – we love it when you do! Team Cherry hereby grants free license – to game owners and press – to use Hollow Knight in the creation and publishing (or streaming) of original media content, including reviews, gameplay videos and Let’s Plays. Team Cherry also grants free license to content creators to monetise these works, whether through advertising, stream donations, or otherwise.
            Can I sell Hollow Knight merchandise?</p>

        <h2 class="question_title"><b>Are there any internships, paid positions or work-experience opportunities open at Team Cherry?</b></h2>
        <p class="questions_text">Not at the moment, sorry! We like to keep the team pretty small, and unfortunately we don’t often have the spare time to take on interns. If an opening does come up, we’ll let everyone know here on the site and on social media.</p>
    
        <h2 class="question_title"><b>What do you use to make games?</b></h2>
        <p class="questions_text">We use Unity to build games for all platforms, utilising assets like PlayMaker, TextMesh Pro and 2d Toolkit from the asset store. All the art assets from the games, including animations, were drawn in Photoshop. The Hollow Knight prototype was developed using Stencyl – give it a try if you want to learn how to make games yourself!</p>
